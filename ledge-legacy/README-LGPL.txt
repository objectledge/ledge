All the source code distributed in this package is covered by a BSD license, as displayed in 
LICENCE.txt file. However, to compile these certain libraries covered by LGPL licenses.
Therefore the resulting object code (classes) may be covered by section 6 of the LGPL.

Consequences for your source code and binaries.

Application's source code is not affected license-wise unless you explicitly import classes
found in this module, for extension and other usage. If you do that the resulting object code
may be covered by section 6 of the LGPL in the same way as source files in this module.

Application's executable is affected in the following way: if a particular class from
this module is required for your application to run, you need to include license information 
about the LGPL libraries it depends on in your application documentation and runtime copyright
notices if your application displays them.

See LGPL contents for more information: http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php
